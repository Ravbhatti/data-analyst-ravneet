# *Surviving the Titanic: Exploratory Data Analysis*  

## *üìå Project Overview*  
This project performs an *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)* on the *Titanic dataset* to uncover factors influencing passenger survival. Using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), we analyze key features like *age, gender, class, and fare* to identify survival trends.  

---

## *üîç Methodology*  

### *1. Data Collection & Preparation*  
- Loaded and cleaned the dataset (handled missing values, dropped irrelevant columns).  
- Converted data types for better analysis like, categorical encoding.  

### *2. Descriptive Statistics*  
- Analyzed numerical features (Age, Fare) and categorical distributions (Pclass, Sex).  
- Calculated survival rates across different groups.  

### *3. Data Visualization*  
- *Histograms & Boxplots*: Examined distributions of Age and Fare.  
- *Bar Charts*: Compared survival rates by gender, class, and age groups.  
- *Heatmaps*: Visualized correlations between numerical variables.  

### *4. Survival Analysis*  
- Gender: Women had a *74% survival rate* vs. *19% for men* (p < 0.0001).  
- Class: *1st-class passengers* had the highest survival rate (~63%).  
- Age: *Children (<12)* had better survival chances, especially in higher classes.

## *üí° Key Insights & Findings*  
‚úî *"Women and children first" policy was evident* ‚Äì females and young passengers had significantly higher survival rates.  
‚úî *Class disparity* ‚Äì 1st-class passengers had *3x higher survival* than 3rd-class.  
‚úî *Age mattered* ‚Äì Children in 1st/2nd class were prioritized, while elderly passengers struggled.

## *üéØ Conclusion & Next Steps*  
The analysis confirms *socioeconomic and demographic biases* in Titanic survival. Further steps could include:  
- *Predictive modeling* (Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to classify survival.  
- *Feature engineering* (family size = SibSp + Parch) for deeper insights.  
- *Hypothesis testing* to validate observed trends statistically.

# Understanding Shopping Patterns in Istanbul Malls (2021-2023)

## Project Description
This project analyzes customer purchase data from 10 major shopping malls in Istanbul between 2021-2023 to identify key shopping trends and behaviors.

## Objective
To uncover actionable insights about:
- Seasonal shopping patterns
- Product category preferences
- Payment method trends
- Customer segmentation
- Mall performance comparisons

## Dataset
The dataset contains 994,482 transactions with:
- Invoice details (number, date, time)
- Customer demographics (age, gender)
- Purchase information (category, quantity, price)
- Payment methods (cash, credit, debit)
- Mall locations

## Key Findings
1. *Peak Shopping*: July 2021 saw highest sales (likely due to post-pandemic recovery)
2. *Top Category*: Clothing dominated with 114M TL in sales
3. *Payment*: Cash preferred (44.7%) over cards
4. *Segments*: 
   - New Customers (45,402)
   - Hibernating (44,997) 
   - Potential Loyalists (6,563)

## Recommendations
1. *Inventory Planning*: Boost clothing stock before summer season
2. *Promotions*: Target cash users with loyalty programs
3. *Staffing*: Increase weekend workforce
4. *Marketing*: Reactivate hibernating customers
5. *Mall Strategies*: Customize offerings based on time patterns

## Methodology
1. *Data Preparation*: Cleaned 994K+ records, handled missing values
2. *Analysis*: Calculated RFM metrics, time trends, category distributions
3. *Visualization*: Created interactive dashboards of key metrics
4. *Segmentation*: Identified 6 distinct customer groups

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- RFM analysis
