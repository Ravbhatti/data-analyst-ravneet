# Data Wrangling for Enhanced Customer Analytics at EcoBloom

## Project Description

This project focuses on performing comprehensive data wrangling for customer analytics at EcoBloom, a sustainable home goods retailer. The goal is to clean, transform, and consolidate data from various sources to create a robust dataset for analysis. This will enable better decision-making and targeted marketing strategies.

## Datasets

The project uses the following datasets:

* **sales.csv:** Contains sales transaction records, including customer IDs, purchase amounts, product details, and timestamps.
* **customers.csv:** Contains customer demographic details such as age, gender, location, and account creation date.
* **service.csv:** Contains customer service records, including inquiry types, resolutions, and timestamps.
* **marketing.csv:** Contains marketing interaction data, including campaign names, email open rates, click-through rates, and timestamps.

## Methodology

1.  **Data Collection:**
    * Gathered Ecobloom datasets from CSV files.
2.  **Data Assessment:**
    * Conducted an initial assessment of data quality to identify missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
    * Documented data types, formats, and discrepancies.
3.  **Data Cleaning:**
    * Addressed missing values through imputation.
    * Removed duplicate records.
    * Standardized date formats.
4.  **Data Transformation:**
